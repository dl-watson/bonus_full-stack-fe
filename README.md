# bonus_full-stack-fe

Goal: create a full-stack CRUD app.

Deployed link: https://ecstatic-franklin-fe3f2d.netlify.app/

### Process

Make vertical slices to create a CRUD app:

* on your back-end create the insert method on your model.

* on your back-end create your POST route

* on your front-end create a service to POST to your route

* on your front-end create a form that uses your POST service

More generically:

* on your back-end create a method on your model
* on your back-end create a route
* on your front-end create a service to use your route
* on your front-end create a view

### Architecture

You can use any architecture for this lab (Container/Presentation, hooks, custom hooks, context/provider).

### Testing

Test your routes with supertest
Snapshot testing
Behavior test your front-end

### Rubric

> 4 points per slice

> 1 point for the back-end

> 3 points for the front-end
